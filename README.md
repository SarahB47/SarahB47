- Analyzed a comprehensive dataset of major power outages in the U.S. from January 2000 to July 2016 to identify the correlation between weather conditions and power outage durations, focusing specifically on the impact of colder weather on the length of outages.
- Conducted extensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to refine the dataset for relevant variables, implemented hypothesis testing to examine the relationship between power outage durations and cold weather, and communicated findings through clear insights.
- Utilized statistical methods and permutation tests to validate the hypothesis that colder weather leads to longer power outage durations, contributing to the development of strategies for improving infrastructure resilience and emergency response during adverse weather conditions.

- Considered how different factors such as income level, geography, year, non-local license plates, and car types affected parking distributions in Los Angeles County.
- Constructed bar charts and visualizations to depict the trends between parking tickets and AMI categories.
- Investigated whether parking citations were more frequently reported in lower-income areas compared to higher-income areas.
- Performed a chi-square test to determine if the parking ticket distribution aligns with the AMI distribution of LA; rejected the null hypothesis, indicating that the number of parking tickets is influenced by variables other than the original AMI dataset distribution.

- Developed a customized Convolutional Neural Network for the Olivetti dataset based on the ResNet18 architecture.
- Utilized the Olivetti dataset, consisting of 400 facial images distributed among 40 classes, with ten images per class representing different individuals.
- Tested different combinations of activation functions and optimization methods: ReLU with Adam, Leaky ReLU with Adam, Tanh with Adam, ReLU with SGD, Leaky ReLU with SGD, and Tanh with SGD.
- Explored hyper-parameter tuning of various optimization and activation functions, resulting in a test accuracy of 97% and
training loss of 0.001.
- Authored detailed machine learning report clarifying neural network concepts and experimental findings, such as the ResNet architecture, convolutional layers, pooling layers, activation functions, and optimization functions.
