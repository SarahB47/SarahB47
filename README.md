- Analyzed a comprehensive dataset of major power outages in the U.S. from January 2000 to July 2016 to identify the correlation between weather conditions and power outage durations, focusing specifically on the impact of colder weather on the length of outages.
- Conducted extensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to refine the dataset for relevant variables, implemented hypothesis testing to examine the relationship between power outage durations and cold weather, and communicated findings through clear insights.
- Utilized statistical methods and permutation tests to validate the hypothesis that colder weather leads to longer power outage durations, contributing to the development of strategies for improving infrastructure resilience and emergency response during adverse weather conditions.

### [Analyzing Parking Ticket Distributions Based on Medium Income Levels](https://github.com/SarahB47/COGS108-Final-Project)
<img alt="Tools | Python" width="22px" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/python/python-plain.svg" /> <img alt="Tools | Pandas" width="22px" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/pandas/pandas-original.svg" /> <img alt="Tools | Numpy" width="22px" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/numpy/numpy-original.svg" /> <img alt="Tools | Matplotlib" width="22px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Created_with_Matplotlib-logo.svg/1200px-Created_with_Matplotlib-logo.svg.png" />
- Considered how different factors such as income level, geography, year, non-local license plates, and car types affected parking distributions in Los Angeles County.
- Constructed bar charts and visualizations to depict the trends between parking tickets and AMI categories.
- Investigated whether parking citations were more frequently reported in lower-income areas compared to higher-income areas.
- Performed a chi-square test to determine if the parking ticket distribution aligns with the AMI distribution of LA; rejected the null hypothesis, indicating that the number of parking tickets is influenced by variables other than the original AMI dataset distribution.

<img alt="Tools | Python" width="22px" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/python/python-plain.svg" /> <img alt="Tools | SciKit Learn" width="22px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Scikit_learn_logo_small.svg" /> <img alt="Tools | Pandas" width="22px" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/pandas/pandas-original.svg" /> <img alt="Tools | Plotly" width="40px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Plotly-logo.png" /> 
- Developed and fine-tuned a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) regression model to predict the durations of power outages based on influential factors like cause, geography, and population metrics, using a dataset that included detailed information on past power outage events.
- Conducted rigorous data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to identify key predictors, manage outliers, and ensure data quality, which included encoding categorical variables and selecting relevant quantitative features for model training.
- Evaluated the model's performance using root mean square error (RMSE) and R-squared metrics, performed a fairness analysis comparing predictions across different U.S. regions, and refined the model by incorporating features like peak energy consumption hours and population metrics to improve prediction accuracy.
