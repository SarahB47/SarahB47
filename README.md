- Analyzed a comprehensive dataset of major power outages in the U.S. from January 2000 to July 2016 to identify the correlation between weather conditions and power outage durations, focusing specifically on the impact of colder weather on the length of outages.
- Conducted extensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to refine the dataset for relevant variables, implemented hypothesis testing to examine the relationship between power outage durations and cold weather, and communicated findings through clear insights.
- Utilized statistical methods and permutation tests to validate the hypothesis that colder weather leads to longer power outage durations, contributing to the development of strategies for improving infrastructure resilience and emergency response during adverse weather conditions.

- Considered how different factors such as income level, geography, year, non-local license plates, and car types affected parking distributions in Los Angeles County.
- Constructed bar charts and visualizations to depict the trends between parking tickets and AMI categories.
- Investigated whether parking citations were more frequently reported in lower-income areas compared to higher-income areas.
- Performed a chi-square test to determine if the parking ticket distribution aligns with the AMI distribution of LA; rejected the null hypothesis, indicating that the number of parking tickets is influenced by variables other than the original AMI dataset distribution.

        - Player and Dealer Hands: Developed a PlayerHand class to manage player hands, including adding and sorting cards.
          Created a DealerHand class, which inherits from PlayerHand, with additional functionality to reveal or hide cards           as needed.
        - Gameplay Mechanics: The game calculates and returns scores based on the cards in hand. Allows for adding                    additional cards to the player's hand. Determines the winner by comparing the scores of the player and the dealer.
        - Game Summaries and Logging: Generated detailed game summaries, including a log of each round with information               about money in the wallet, bets placed, player and dealer cards, and the winner. Provided comprehensive                     documentation tests to ensure reliability and functionality.

- This project emphasized object-oriented programming principles, such as class attributes and inheritance, to create a robust and engaging Blackjack game experience.
